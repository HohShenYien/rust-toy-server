# RUST TOY SERVER

This is the final project listed in the [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
book. Most of the codes come from the book, however, I am planning to add on
more features as times come to practise and improve my Rust skills. As of now,
it is merely a side project that has no real usage yet.

This server will listen to 127.0.0.1:7878.
